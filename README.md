# Solidity Projects

This repository contains a collection of Solidity smart contract projects developed for various purposes.

## Usage

To use the Solidity files in Remix IDE, follow these steps:

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New File**: Click on the "+" icon in the file explorer panel to create a new file.

3. **Copy Solidity Code**: Copy the Solidity code from the file in this repository that you want to use.

4. **Paste into Remix IDE**: Paste the copied Solidity code into the editor in Remix IDE.

5. **Compile Contract**: Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in Remix IDE. Compile the contract by clicking the "Compile" button.

6. **Deploy Contract**: Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix IDE. Deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy" button.

7. **Interact with Contract**: Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using Remix IDE's interface.

## Changing Pragma Version

If you encounter any issues with the pragma version of the Solidity code, you can change it as follows:

1. Open the Solidity file in Remix IDE.

2. Locate the `pragma` statement at the top of the file.

3. Modify the pragma version to the desired version. For example, change `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` to `pragma solidity ^0.9.0;`.

4. Recompile the contract to ensure compatibility with the new pragma version.
